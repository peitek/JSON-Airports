# JSON Airports [![Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/jbrooksuk.png)](https://www.gittip.com/jbrooksuk/)

At [Blue Bay Travel](http://bluebaytravel.co.uk) we needed a list of Airports and their basic informations to provide autocompletion within our internal applications. We searched high and low to find something, but only had a MySQL table from somewhere, so we created this file.

The JSON file, airports.json contains an array of airports and some basic information, incliding:

- Name
- IATA (was previously named code)
- ISO code
- Continent
- Size (if known)
- Type (airport, heliport, seaboats)
- Status (0 = closed, 1 = open)
